# OPAI (Overarching Properties for AI)
## This repository contains results from the FAA funded program - Safety Assurance in Complex Aerospace Digital Systems that include AI/ML

### Repository Layout
- [gsn](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/OPAI/tree/main/gsn): Contains the GSN artifacts produced in the program
- [ML](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/OPAI/tree/main/ML): contains data, code, and ML models used in the program
- [SADL](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/OPAI/tree/main/SADL): comtains the SADL data models developed in the program
- [tools](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/OPAI/tree/main/tools): contains code for all tools developed

### Tools
